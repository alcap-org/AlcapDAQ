This is an introduction to the offline analyzer that produces root trees. I will post replies to this message if anything changes in my code structure.

1) Get the code. You can check out the code by running
svn checkout svn+ssh://mulanbe.psi.ch/home/mulan/subversion-repository/DAQ
in your home directory on the analysis machine

2) Turn on the output you want. In the module DAQ/analyzer/offline/production/modules/make_WFDcoinFill_tree.cpp, at the top, there are defines for RECORD_RAW, RECORD_PULSES, etc. The latter ones are dependent on the former, so if you want to record coincidences, be sure you also record pulses. At some point I will make modifications so the code will find the pulses but not record them if all you want are coincident pulses.

3) compile midas and the analyzer.
a) cd DAQ/midas-1.9.5; make
b) cd DAQ/analyzer/offline/production; make

4) Run the analyzer. NOTE!!! when specifying an output file, use the -T switch rather than the -o switch. This is very important, because the default midas analyzer output does not understand how to create trees.
./ranalyzer -i /mnt/raid/data/run.mid -T /mnt/raid/users/me/output.root -s 0

5) Open and look at the root file.
a) root -l output.root
b) WFDcoinFill->StartViewer()
c) You can point and click in this interface to create histograms

6) Using the command line:
a) You have more control over drawing histograms on the command line. For example
WFDcoinFill->Draw("Y:X>>myhist(300,0,300,400,0,400),"mycut","mydrawoptions",numberOfFills,StartFillNumber)
will draw Y vs X (where these are names like Blocktime and SerialNumber determined from the tree viewer),
pipe the ouput to a histogram named myhist with the number of bins specified in the usual order (nbins, low, high),
apply a cut like "BlockTime>600 && BlockTime<700",
and draw the histogram with options like "colz".
You can leave off the last two parameters if you want to look at the whole tree. If you want to prototype your code, I suggest setting numberOfFills to 1000.

For a 1D histogram, use
WFDcoinFill->Draw("X>>myhist(300,0,300),"mycut","mydrawoptions",numberOfFills,StartFillNumber)

7) TChains
a) You can look at multiple files at once using TChains.
b) TChain *WFDcoinFill=new TChain("WFDcoinFill")
c) WFDcoinFill->AddFile("file1.root")
d) WFDcoinFill->AddFile("file2.root")
...
z) WFDcoinFill->StartViewer() or WFDcoinFill->Draw(...)
