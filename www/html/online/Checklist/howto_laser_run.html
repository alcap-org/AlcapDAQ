<h3>HOWTO take "Laser" run (internal trigger mode).</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>Step 01:</b> Stop the DAQ at the end of the current run.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 02:</b> Open the back door of the Al laser box to see the back of the laser.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 03:</b> Make sure the Trigger switch is set to INT.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 04:</b> Turn the laser on by turning the key so that the orange power light comes on.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 05:</b> Wait untill the green LASER READY light comes on. This takes about 3min to 5min.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 06-Dewar:</b> Now we are using the dewar therefore, open the valve named [EVENT]. This valve provides the N2 gas. The ga 
travels through a metal hose followed by plastic tubing. Also open the valve that heats up the contents so as to maintain pressure.  Do NOT open up the intake [REMPLISSAGE].The pressure normally starts at 3.8 bar and drops during the run to 2.2. If it goes lower than 2 turn off the laser.
<dt><b>Step 06-TANK:</b>(OLD VERSION for tank: Turn on the Nitrogen gas tank, the pressure on the gas tank gauge should be reasonably above 0bar and the guage 
         leading to the laser should be ~ 6.5 bar.)</dt>
<dt><b>Step 07:</b> Flip the switch to turn on the red LASER ENABLE light. You should hear a rapid clicking noise. This is the 
         laser firing.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 08:</b> Close the back door of the Al laser box.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 09:</b> On the osciliscope in the mulan barrack in the computer room (near monitor) check the the peak height of the peak 
         height of the PMT, and the time between laser pulses. The PMT should 
         be about 400 mV.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 10:</b> Start the DAQ.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 11:</b> After ~ 30min of running, stop the DAQ at the end of the current run.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 12:</b> Turn off the laser system (flip the switch to turn off the red LASER ENABLE light before turning the key so 
         that the orange power light goes off) and remember to turn off the Nitrogen gas.</dt>
<dt><b>Step 13:</b> Restart the DAQ.</dt>
