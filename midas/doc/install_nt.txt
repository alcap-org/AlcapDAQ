How to install MIDAS under Windows NT
-------------------------------------

The MIDAS archive for Windows NT contains additionally to the
source code all pre-compiled executables.

Follow these steps to do an installation:

1) Unpack midas-x.xx.exe (where x.xx is the current version) to a
directory of your choice (usually c:\) by executing it.

Following directory structure is created:

c:\midas-x.xx             MIDAS root for version x.xx
.\doc                     Documentation
.\src                     Source files
.\include                 Include files
.\drivers                 Device drivers
.\examples                Example programs
.\examples/experiment     Sample experiment
.\nt                      NT makefiles for Visual C++
.\nt\bin                  Executables for Windows NT
.\nt\lib                  Libraries for Windows NT
.\nt\directio             DirectIO kernel driver for HW access
.\nt\service              Run mserver as a NT service

2) Install to MIDAS binaries and libraries. Enter:

  cd \midas-x.xx
  install

This will install the MIDAS library under c:\midas\nt\lib, 
the MIDAS programs under c:\midas\nt\bin and the include files 
under c:\midas\include. Edit the file install.bat if you want 
to change these directories.

Next define the environment variable MIDASSYS, pointing to the installation
directory, like

set MIDASSYS=c:\midas\nt

or similar. This variable is necessary so that other packages find the
midas library and include files under $MIDASSYS/lib and $MIDASSYS/include.
To make this variable permanent, use the system properties panel
(usually Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables/
System Variables/New). You need to re-open all command windows to see
this change.

3) Set the path environment variable to the MIDAS executables at
c:\midas\nt\bin. To do so, right-click on the "My Computer"
icon on the desktop. Select "Properties" from the menue. On the
dialog box, click on the "environment" tab. Under "System
variables", search and select "Path". On the "value" field, go
to the end of the path and add the MIDAS executable direcotry.
The path should then look somehow like:

  %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;c:\midas\nt\bin;

Press the "Set" and "OK" button.

4) Make sure the CERN library is installed properly. The MIDAS
analyzer needs libpacklib.a which is usually installed under
\cern\lib.

5) Create a working directory which hosts the frontend and analyzer
program of your experiment (in the following example called "online"). 
Copy the example experiment as a starting point and compile it: 

  mkdir c:\online
  cd \online
  copy \midas-x.xx\examples\experiment\* .

  nmake -f makefile.nt frontend.exe
  nmake -f makefile.nt analyzer.exe

It might be that the libraries CONSOLE.LIB and MSFRT.LIB are missing 
during the linking of the analyzer. In this case, copy both libraries 
from \midas-x.xx\nt\lib to the default library directory of you 
compiler, usually c:\msdev\lib.

6) Set the environment variable MIDAS_DIR to point to your directory.
Open the "environment" dialog box as under 3). Then enter "MIDAS_DIR"
in the "Variable" box and "c:\online" in the "Value" box (without
quotation marks). Press the "Set" and "OK" buttons.

7) Test the system by running a sample experiment with a frontend which
produces random data:

  cd c:\online\debug
  start frontend
  start analyzer
  start mlogger

Start and stop a run

  [local]/> start
  ...<hit return to accept default values>...
  [local]/> stop

The frontend should produce trigger and scaler events. The analyzer
gets those events and histogramms them. Now you can run PAW and look
at the N-tuples and histos:

  pawnt
  PAW> hi/hio/gl onln
  PAW> hi/list
  PAW> hi/pl 1000

8) If everything workes fine, you can edit the frontend and analyzer 
to suit your experiment. This is of course the main work. To understand
the modular analyzer concept, read http://pibeta.psi.ch/handbook/analyzer.

9) If the frontend runs on another computer, the MIDAS server program
has to be installed. You can either start mserver manually or as a
NT service. To start mserver as a service, execute 

  c:\midas-x.xx\nt\service\install.bat

and follow the instructions printed by this batch file. 

To connect to different experiments, the server has to know in which 
directories and under which user names the experiments are running. 
For this purpose a list of all experiments running on a machine has 
to be defined in a file called "exptab". This file is located under 
C:\winnt\system32 and contains one line for each experiment describing 
the experiment name and the directory. Create this file with an editor 
and write following line:

Test c:\online

this defines experiment "Test" in directory c:\online.

To test the server, start odbedit with the host flag

  odbedit -h <your-host>

10) If you want to access hardware directly under Windows NT, you have
to install the DirectIO driver. Using this driver it is possible for
example to access a PC-CAMAC interface in the frontend program running
directly on the Windows NT machine.
