                    MIDAS Usage with the PCOS setup
                    ===============================

Introduction
------------

The MIDAS data acquisition system reads trigger data from CAMAC, writes it
to disk/tape and presents histograms and N-tuples to PAW. Each of these
tasks is performed by one process: Frontend, Logger and Analyzer. All
parameters of the system are stored in an "online database". They can be
edited with the ODBEdit program. 

Starting DAQ
------------

First, start the data acquisition by double clicking the DAQ icons in the
yellow folder labeled "midas" on the Windows NT desktop.  If this
processes is already running ("DAQ" icon in the Windows task bar at the
bottom of the screen is present), don't start DAQ again. 

Controlling DAQ
---------------

Start ODBedit. This program is a simple command interface to the MIDAS
system. Following commands are used most often: 

start              to start a run
stop               to stop a run
histo <id>         to clear histos/n-tuples
cd <dir>           to go to a subdirectory
cd ..              go one directory up
dir                to list a directory
set <key> <value>  to set a value in the ODB

If a directory or key contains blanks, embrace them with quotation marks
like

  set "/runinfo/run number" 123

Following values are of major interest:

- /runinfo/run number    
  the current run number, gets incremented by the start command

- /logger/channels/0/state
  set this value to "on" or "off" to enable logging to disk
 
- /logger/channels/1/state
  set this value to "on" or "off" to enable logging to tape

- /logger/channels/0/statistics
  contains the number of logged events

- /equipment/trigger/variables
  contains the last trigger event

- /equipment/trigger/settings
  contains CAMAC parameters

- /analyzer/parameters
  contains analyzer parameters

Viewing histos
--------------

Start PAW. The \midas\work\pawlogon.kumac file attaches automatically to
the online data with the "hi/gl onln" command. 

Now all standard PAW commands can be used. Follwing histograms are
defined: 

100-         raw ADC histo where
200-         pedestal subtracted ADC histo
300-         TDC histos
400-         chamber histos
500-         chamber 2D histos

These histograms are saved into runxxxx.hbook (where xxxx is the run
number) in the \midas\work\data directory at the end of a run. They can be
loaded later into PAW with

PAW> hi/file 1 \midas\work\data\run1234.hbook

Paw then switches to the internal //LUN1 directory, which contains the
histograms from run 1234. To switch back to the online histos, enter

PAW> cd //onln

To turn on statistics, date and file display in PAW, enter

PAW> opt stat
PAW> opt date
PAW> opt file

These commands can also written to the c:\midas\work\pawlogon.kumac file.

An online N-tuple with ID 1 is defined, too. This N-tuple contains the
last 10000 ADC, TDC and wire chamber values. After 10000 events, the first
events gets overwritten (ring-buffer). All N-tupe operations like

PAW> nt/pl 1.adc0%adc1 tdc0>100

can be used. 

To make MIDAS controllable from inside PAW, following 
macros were defined:

exec start         to start a run
exec stop          to stop a run
exec clear         to clear all histos
exec clear 1       to clear N-tuple 1
exec print1        to prepare for printing
exec print2        to print everything which was displayed between
                   print1 and print2
exec cleanup       Reset the DAQ system

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the system hangs, never reboot the computer! Instead, enter the PAW
command

exec cleanup

This command stops the DAQ program and PAW. Then restart the DAQ program
and PAW. Note that you cannot start DAQ when PAW is running, so make sure
PAW is not running when DAQ is started. 

If the problem still persists, check the hardware:

- Is the CAMAC crate power on ?
- Does the hardware produce triggers ?
- Does the ADC get proper gates ?
