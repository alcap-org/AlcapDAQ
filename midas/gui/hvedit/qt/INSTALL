How to install hvEdit
---------------------

You need to have installed Qt version 3.0.3 or higher. Qt 3.0.3
is part of Redhat 7.3 or higher.


1) generating the Makefile from hvEdit.pro
   ---------------------------------------

The Makefile is created by the following command:

   qmake hvEdit.pro

If everything goes smoothly there should be a file Makefile. hvEdit.pro
assumes that a system variable MIDAS_ROOT exists which points to the current
midas directory. Furthermore there is a variable HOME in the hvEdit.pro
file which might be modified by the user beforehand executing qmake. HOME
points to the directory where hvEdit shall be installed.


2) Build hvEdit
   ------------

Simply execute

   make

This will start the build procedure which takes some time. In order to get rid
of all the object files etc. you should execute at the end

   make clean
  
which removes all necessary files again.
