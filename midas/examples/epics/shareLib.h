/*
 * Use compiler specific key words to set up shareable library
 * external symbols and entry points
 *
 * Right now this is only necessary for WIN32 DLL, and to a lesser extent VAXC.
 * The approach should be general enough for future systems, however.
 *
 *
 * USAGE:
 *
 * In header files, declare variables, classes and functions
 * to be __exported__ like this:
 *
 *	epicsShareFunc int epicsShareAPI 
 *			a_func (int arg); 	function prototype
 * or
 *	epicsShareFunc int epicsShareAPIV 
 *			a_func (int arg, ...); 	variable args function prototype
 *                                                (using either ... or va_list)
 *	epicsShareExtern  int a_var; 		reference variable
 *                                                (reference declaration)
 *	epicsShareDef int a_var= 4; 		create variable instance
 *                                                (definition declaration)
 *	class epicsShareClass a_class; 		reference a class 
 *
 * Usually the epicsShare... macros expand to
 *  "import this from a DLL"  (on WIN32, on Unix it's a NOOP)
 *
 * In the implementation file, however, you write:
 *
 *  #include <routines_imported.h>
 *  #include <routines_imported_from_other_dlls.h>
 *  #define epicsExportSharedSymbols
 *  ! no more includes specifying routines outside this DLLs from here on ! 
 *  #include <shareLib.h>
 *  #include <in_this_dll_but_not_implemented_in_this_file.h>
 *  #include <what_I_implement_in_this_file.h>
 *
 * The point is: define epicsExportSharedSymbols exactly and only
 * right before you include the prototypes for what you implement!
 * Then include shareLib.h again because this is where they get changed.
 * This time the epicsShare... macros expand to
 *  "export this from the DLL that we are building". (again only on WIN32)
 *
 * NOTE:
 * If what_I_implement_in_this_file.h includes header files for routines that
 * are not implemented in the DLL, then you will need to force these
 * header files to be included before setting epicsExportSharedSymbols,
 * including shareLib.h, and including what_I_implement_in_this_file.h. Since
 * all well written header files have "ifdef" guards against multiple inclusion
 * this is only a matter of "preincluding" the headers for these DLL
 * imports before epicsExportSharedSymbols is defined. This
 * is admittedly a bit of a mess, but is fortunately only the concern of
 * persons who are adding routines to a library, and will have no impact
 * on persons using routines out of a library.
