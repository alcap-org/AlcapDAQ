Following basic examples are included
======================================

odb_test:
---------

A simple test program which shows basic ODB operation. It read
a value from the online database (the run number), increments
it and writes it back to the ODB. Then it opens a "hot link" to
that value and enters an infinite loop. Whenever the run number
gets changed by someone else (like from ODBEdit), the local
function run_number_changes is called automatically.

msgdump:
--------

Displays all messages produced via the cm_msg call in other clients.

analyzer:
---------

Very basic analyzer which requests two event types (trigger event 
ID 1 and scaler event ID 2). It simply prints a notification when one
of the events is received. This program has to becompiles together
with mana.c to work properly.

minife:
-------

Mini-Frontend showing the basic concept of a MIDAS frontend. It
connects to an experiment and and waits for a run start command via 
an RPC call. When a run is started, it sends empty events with
ID 1.

Normally, the mfe.c frontend framework is used to build a frontend.


minirc:
-------

Mini-Runcontrol program which can be used to start and stop a run.
Usually this is done inside odbedit.
