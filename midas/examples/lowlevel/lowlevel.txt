Following low-level examples are included
=========================================

produce:
--------

A simple data producer. It simply connects to a buffer on the local
machine (not possible under MS-DOS) or to a remote host which has the
server program running. 

An event-id can be selected (e.g. 1 or 2 or so), a host (either enter
RETURN for the local host or the IP name for a remote host), an event
size (1 Byte up to 64k) and a cache size. The cache is installed on
the machine where the buffer is created and limits the access to the
buffer by caching the data. This avoids numerous semaphore calls and
speeds up data transfer expecially for small event sizes. 

The producer just generates dummy events until it is interrupted via
Ctrl-C. 

consume:
--------

A simple consumer getting data from a local or remote host and
checking the data inegrety. First, the first and last word in the
events is checked in order to detect overwritten data, then the serial
number of the event is checked in order to detect lost events. 

By specifying different id's, several types of events can be passed
through the same buffer although this is not advisable for high rate
applications.


rpc_test:
---------

A simple program to test the RPC layer in MIDAS. It connects to a
MIDAS server and executes a test routine on the server.

rpc_srvr, rpc_clnt:
-------------------

This is a standalone RPC server and client which do not use any midas
functionality. This can be used to implement simple RPC client/server
programs which have nothing to do with midas
