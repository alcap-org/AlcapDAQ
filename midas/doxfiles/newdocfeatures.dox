Some of the midas features are not yet fully documented or even referenced
anywhere in the documentation.

This section will maintain an up-to-date information with a log 
of the latest documentation on past and current features. It will also
mention the wish list documentation on current developments.
 

- <b> Current doc revision: 1.9.5-0 </b>
- <b> Software version: 1.9.5 </b>
- <b> Latest tarball : <a href=http://midas.triumf.ca/download> 1.9.5 </a> </b>
- <b> Latest RPM : <a href=http://midas.triumf.ca/download> 1.9.2-1  </a> </b>

- <b> [1.9.5] </b>
 - <b> When upgrading to 1.9.5, \em ALL midas applications including user
   applications needs to be rebuild \em AND the \b ODB.SHM (.ODB.SHM) shared
   memory need to be removed. Prior the removal of the ODB.SHM, the ODB database
   can be saved in ASCII format for later restoration. </b>
 - <b> @ref Transition_sequence changed to multiple level scheme. </b>
 - <b> odbedit_task support of XML format for ODB dump. </b>
 - <b> Large File support (>2GB) from @ref mlogger_task application. </b>
 - <b> @ref Folder Root Histogram support within mana. </b>
 - <b> @ref mevb_task application. </b>
 - <b> New @ref frontend_task argument for Event Builder option (-i index). </b>
   - <b> Documentation on "Tests" results from analyzer.</b>
 - <b> @ref mySQL support from @ref mlogger_task. </b>
 - <b> Increase system wide parameters values (see midas.h).
 - <b> Fix numerous small annoying bugs... </b>
 - <b> Improve debugging messages in mserver -d (/tmp/mserver.log). </b>

- <b> [<1.9.5] </b>
 - In writing
  - <b> Epics Slow Control documentation </b>

  - <b> Introduce @ref MIDASSYS environment variable </b>
  - <b> Analyzer documention revision @ref analyzer_struct </b>
  - <b> Watchdog bug fix (RH9.0) </b>

  - <b> Restructured Midas distribution </b>
   - In the same effort as the documentation, the midas tree and CVS have been  
     modified. The <a href=http://midas.triumf.ca/download> download area </a> now
     contains separate directories for doc, add-ons, publications etc.
 - <b> [DOCUMENTATION in progress] </b>
  - A large effort has been put on the documentation for switching from the
  \b DOC++ to <a href=http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/features.html> Doxygen</a>
  We feel the cross-referencing to the source code is excellent and hopefully
  will server better its purpose. Currently the @ref analyzer_struct is not complete
  as well as the @ref quickstart. This \b Doxygen related files will be made accessible
  for better update.
  
 - <b> [Midas Short Course] </b>
  - During the RealTime Conference 2003 held in Montreal, a short course
  was offered to introduce the Midas DAQ to the audience. This course (.ppt, .pdf) is now
  part of the Midas distribution and can be found under the doc/course/ directory
  as 2 files (part1, part2). The Part 1 describes the basic of the system and its
  implementation, while part 2 lists specific features.
  <a href=http://midas.triumf.ca/download/course/course_rt03.zip>
   Part1.pdf, Part2.pdf </a>.

- <b> [1.9.3] </b>
  - Support for ROOT files.
  - @ref mlogger_task: New Data format \b ROOT and corresponding file extension
    \b root
  - @ref rmidas_task: Initial Root/Midas GUI for Histogram and Run control.
  - @ref analyzer_struct: New framework for Online/Offline Root analysis using socket
    connection.
  - \b Makefile for ROOT, remove \b MANA_LITE, create @ref HAVE_ROOT, @ref HAVE_HBOOK.
  -  New Analyzer \b mana, \b hmana, \b rmana depending on the type of package.

- <b> [1.9.2] </b>
  - odbedit: \<tab\> completion is working with flags too, "Load" protect the data dir if
     changed.
  - @ref lazylogger_task: This task has been improved for tape manilupation as well as
    messages display. It has also now extra fiilds for shell scripts when the tape rewinds.
    It supports also split run capability when running multiple instance of the task.
    Please refer to the documentation for explanation of the new fields.
  - mlxspeaker: Added possible system call to wav file for "beeping" user before message.
  - mhist: Add index range for -i with -v.
  - eventbuilder: Revised version with user code scheme. Still in a development stage.
  - cm_cleanup() if you were using this call, you need now to provide an empty char arg to
    make it compatible.

- <b> [1.9.1] </b>
  - This version addresses several bugs reported in the web interface, history,
logger, odbedit and implements new features in particular for the history pages on web
interface. The detail list of the modifications can be found in
<a href=http://midas.triumf.ca/download/CHANGELOG> CHANGELOG </a>.
    - <b>[EQ_FRAGMENTED]</b> Possibility to send extremely large event through the system without
      modification of the system configuration (see @ref The_Equipment_Structure)
    - <b>[logger subdir option]</b> Allows to redirect the data files to a subdirectory based on 
      the time of the creation of the data file (see @ref ODB_Logger_Tree).
    - Option for building an analyzer without the CERN library (HBOOK)
      (see @ref AppendixD).
    - <b>[ MOD. REQ.]</b> This release requires several modifications in the
      user code in order to compile the 1.9.1.
      -# <b>[db_get_value() function]</b> Requires an extra parameter see @ref Midas_Library.
      -# <b>[max_event_size_frag]</b> Required in all the frontend code as follow:
\code
// maximum event size produced by this frontend
INT max_event_size = 10000;
// maximum event size for fragmented events (EQ_FRAGMENTED) 
INT max_event_size_frag = 5*1024*1024;
\endcode
  - <b>[/Logger tree]</b> As this tree includes new field, you will need to recreate this tree.
  - <b>[general]</b> It is wise to create a fresh ODB when switching to 1.9.1 version.
    This can be done by:
    -# removing all attached midas client to your experiment
    -# saving the current ODB to a file
    -# removing all shared memory files (hidden files .*.SHM)
    -# creating new ODB (odbedit -s size)
    -# trimming the odb save file to keep user specific structures (if any).
    -# restoring the trimmed odb file.

- <b> [<1.9.1] </b>
  - Hopefully nobody is still running an older version.
