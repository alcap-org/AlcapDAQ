Si16b Analyses

1) Produce subtrees
=====================
Creates the following "subtrees":
 - siBlockTree_SiT ("thin" layer = SiT, "thick" layer = emtpy, "third" layer = empty)
 - siBlockTree_Target ("thin" layer = SiL1, "thick" layer = SiR1, "third" layer = SiR2)
 - siBlockTree_SiL ("thin" layer = SiL1, "thick" layer = SiL3, "third" layer = empty)
   NB SiL3 is in its detector position and is not actually behind the target
 - siBlockTree_SiR ("thin" layer = SiR1, "thick" layer = SiR2, "third" layer = SiR3)
 
 - geTree_GeHiGain
 - geTree_GeLoGain

 - geTargetTree_GeHiGain
 - geTargetTree_GeLoGain

2) Plots
=========
Runs the following scripts to create plots, which have the given parameters, on the given subtrees:

2) Normalisation
=================
Runs the following scripts to count the number of stopped muons in various ways:

 - CountStoppedMuons_XRaySpectrum.C
   -- input plots: GeLoGain/hEnergyTime, GeHiGain/hEnergyTime       (from XRaySpectrum.C)
    	    	   Ge{Lo/Hi}Gain_wTargetCoinc_MuonSlice/hEnergyTime (from XRaySpectrum_wTargetCoinc.C)
   -- parameters: material, transition, ge eff run		    (for defining the X-ray energy and efficiency)
      		  rebin factor, fit window min, fit window max      (for fitting the X-ray peak)
		  min time, max time	   	    	   	    (for time cut)

 - CountStoppedMuons_TargetSpectrum.C
   -- input plots: Target/hEnergyTime		   (from TargetSpectrum.C)
   -- parameters: min muon time, max muon time	   (for muon hit definition in target)
      		  min muon energy, max muon energy (for muon hit definition in target)


3) Lifetime
============
Runs the following script to fit the muonic atom lifetime to a time distribution:

 - LifetimeFit.C
   -- input plots: proton_SiR_timecut/hTime		   (from EvdEPlot.C)
      	    	   SiL3/hEnergyTime			   (from TargetSpectrum.C)
   -- parameters: min fit time, max fit time, rebin factor (for the fitting)
      		  double exp, flat bkg	      	    	   (for the fit function)
		  project X, project Y			   (for projecting onto a time axis if needs be)

4) Raw Spectra
===============
Runs the following scripts to create raw energy spectra:

 - RawSpectrum_fromEvdE.C
   -- input plots: proton_SiR_timecut/hEvdE (from EvdEPlot.C)
   -- parameters: vector of histograms      (for combining the two layer and three layer plots)
      		  vector of scale rations   (because SiR3 has a lower acceptance than SiR2)

 - RawSpectrum_fromEnergyTime.C
   -- input plots: SiL3/hEnergyTime   (from TargetSpectrum.C)
   -- parameters:  min time, max time (for time slice)
