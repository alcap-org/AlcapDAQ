Instructions for the scripts in this folder:

1. Counting Stopped Muons
Starting from a rootana output file with a 2D plot of energy vs time for the TAPs
  - run XRaySpectrum.C
  - run CountStoppedMuons.C

2. Producing EvdE Plots
Starting from a rootana output file with a TME tree
  - run EvdEPlot.C to generate EvdE plots and the time plot for things that pass that proton cut
  - run LifetimeFit.C to fit the muonic atom lifetime

3. Extracting Proton Bands
  - this is done in EvdEPlot.C
  - to plot the folded spectrum run FoldedSpectrum.C on the result of EvdEPlot.C

4. Unfolding
  - you'll need a response matrix from the MC
  - then you can run UnfoldProtonSpectrum.C to generate a new ROOT File

5. Final Plots and Fits
  - 

6. Pretty Plots
  - run PrettyPlot.C to generate pretty plots
