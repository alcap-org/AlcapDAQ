RooUnfold             $Id$
=========

RooUnfold is a framework for unfolding (AKA "deconvolution" or "unsmearing").
It currently implements several methods: iterative (Bayes),
singular value decomposition (SVD), unregularised matrix inversion,
bin-by-bin (simple correction factors), and an interface to ROOT's TUnfold.
It can be used from the ROOT prompt, or linked against the ROOT libraries.
RooUnfold requires ROOT 4 or later.
