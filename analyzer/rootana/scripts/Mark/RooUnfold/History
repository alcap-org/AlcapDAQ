History of RooUnfold     $Id$
====================

Tim Adye         15-Feb-2018
  o Always use local version of TSVDUnfold, unless explicitly disabled with
    "make HAVE_TSVDUNFOLD=0". Previously TSVDUnfold_local.h was not included
    for ROOT6, which gave problems with RooUnfoldSvd::Impl().
    Problem reported by Yaxian Mao (ALICE).
  o Fix double delete in RooUnfoldTest.cxx etc (actually examples/ArgVars.h)
    for ROOT 6.12.

Tim Adye         10-Nov-2017
  o Apply small fixes from ROOT 6.10 to local copy of TSVDUnfold.cxx.
  o Use "nosw2" option for TH1::Scale() in RooUnfoldTest to stop errors
    being added in ROOT 6.08.

Tim Adye         24-Aug-2017
  o Add #include "TBuffer.h" required since ROOT 6.08, also for RooUnfoldIds.cxx.
  o Move unneeded include from RooUnfoldIds.h to .cxx.
  o Link -lUnfold (for TUnfold) if available (moved out of -lHist with ROOT 6.10).
    Bugs reported by Salvatore Rappoccio.

Tim Adye         18-Jul-2017
  o Add description of RooUnfoldIds to RooUnfold.cxx.
  o Fix error propagation using toys in RooUnfoldIds.cxx.
    Changes kindly provided by Chris Meyer.

Tim Adye         11-Jul-2017
  o Add IDS (iterative dynamically stabilized) unfolding implemented
    in the RooUnfoldIds class by Chris Meyer <chris.meyer@cern.ch> using
    the algorithm from Bogdan Malaescu <bogdan.malaescu@cern.ch>.
    The implementation is still under development, but mostly works.
    RooUnfoldIds's error propagation (with toys) seems to have problems,
    but RooUnfold's toy generation (kCovToy) can be used instead.

Tim Adye         10-Feb-2017
  o Add #include "TBuffer.h" required since ROOT 6.08.
  o Fix RooUnfoldTest overflow=1 or 2 when nmx!=ntx.

Tim Adye         14-Apr-2015
  o Make sure RooUnfoldDict_rdict.pcm is in same directory as libRooUnfold.so.
  o Update "make commands".

Tim Adye         13-Apr-2015
  More GNUmakefile fixes for ROOT6:
  o Use rootcling (instead of rlibmap) to make libRooUnfold.rootmap.
  o Include $(CXXFLAGS) (notably -std=c++11) in dependency file creation.
  o Fallback if dependency file creation fails.
  o Fallback if no Makefile.arch, also for ROOT installed in default location.

Tim Adye          7-Oct-2014
  o Fix GNUmakefile for old ROOT (5.30 and before) which defined ROOTCONFIG
    instead of RC [Bug reported by Linda Finco.]

Tim Adye          8-Aug-2014
  o Fixes for compatibility with ROOT 5.34.19 (TUnfold v17.0) and ROOT 6.00.00
    (Cling and TF1::Integral).
  o GNUmakefile now finds ROOT using root-config (with fall-back to $ROOTSYS).
    This works for ROOT installed in default location without $ROOTSYS.

Tim Adye         11-Mar-2014
  o Change way root libraries are pruned for libRooUnfold.rootmap, so it works
    also on MacOSX. MacOSX's grep command doesn't accept "grep -f-" to get
    patterns from stdin.

Tim Adye         30-Jul-2013
  o Use a new version of TSVDUnfold from Kerstin Tackmann which can pick up the
    response matrix errors if they are set, so we don't have to do anything
    special in RooUnfoldSvd.

Tim Adye         29-Jul-2013
  o Update local copy of TSVDUnfold from ROOT 5.34.00, which fixes some memory
    leaks. (Actually used ROOT 5.34.06, which has a comment spelling fix.)
  o Use weighted errors in SVD systematic error if response matrix has error
    weights set (Sumw2() called on input response matrix histogram). This uses
    a private version of TSVDUnfold from Kerstin Tackmann, responding to a
    report by Brian Page.
  o Preserve Sumw2() setting in histograms created by RooUnfoldResponse::H2H1D,
    RooUnfoldResponse::HresponseNoOverflow, and RooUnfold::HistNoOverflow.
  o Don't use TUnfoldSys for systematic errors with TUnfold if not available
    (ROOT 5.22 - previously didn't have TUnfold, later versions had TUnfoldSys).

Tim Adye          2-Jul-2013
  o RooUnfoldTest seed=0 uses a unique seed for each job.

Tim Adye          8-Jan-2013
  o Implement RooUnfoldResponse::Merge so hadd and TFileMerger can merge
    response matrix objects.

Tim Adye          9-Jul-2012
  o Fix rootmap creation with GCC 4.6. [Bug reported by Gavin Hesketh.]
  o Fix double delete in ROOT 5.34 TSVDUnfold.

Tim Adye          6-Jul-2012
  o Change RooUnfold::PrintTable default to show errors as returned by the
    last unfolding (or else kErrors). If kNoError specified, don't show
    error at all. Previously sqrt(N) was shown for the error unless specified
    otherwise in the withError parameter. [Bug reported by Stefan Kluth.]

Tim Adye         12-Jun-2012
  o Add RooUnfoldResponse::MakeFoldingFunction which wraps a TF1 to apply the
    response matrix to a user parametric function. This can be fitted to the
    measured distribution as an alternative to unfolding.
  o RooUnfoldTest fit=1 tests this (test function definitions only implemented
    for the 1D case).
  o Fix some specific compiler warnings.

Tim Adye          8-Jun-2012
  o Fix some GCC 4.6 warnings.

Tim Adye          1-Jun-2012
  o GNUMakefile sets LDFLAGS, even if Makefile.arch not found. Change suggested
    by Martin Woudstra.
  o Add .rootrc file to define ACLiC.IncludePaths, so user doesn't have to
    say ".include src" to run code with ACLiC.

Tim Adye         22-Mar-2012
  o RooUnfoldResponse::ReplaceAxis: keep axis name when copying from another
    axis. Unfolded histogram was getting the x-axis called 'yaxis' (from truth
    axis of response matrix), which breaks TAxis::SetRangeUser.
    Bug reported by Petr Balek.

Tim Adye         27-Jan-2012
  o RooUnfoldSvd deals with fakes by subtracting from the measured input, rather
    than adding an extra effectless-causes bin, which didn't work very well if
    it was much different from its neighbouring bin.
    Giovanni Marchiori reported this problem.
  o Fix PrintTable "total pull". Bug reported by Giovanni Marchiori.
  o Level 2 verbose printout shows results table with algorithm binning.
    Uses new RooUnfold::PrintTable methods.
  o RooUnfoldResponse::Print shows response matrix contents.
  o Matrix debug printout uses new RooUnfoldResponse::PrintMatrix method
    (borrowed from RooUnfoldTestHarness), which is neater than TMatrix::Print.

Tim Adye         15-Dec-2011
  o RooUnfoldResponse::FindBin is now public to help users fill their own
    response matrix histograms. For consistency, there's also now a trivial 1D
    version.
  o 2+3D RooUnfoldResponse::Fill no longer assumes _res has the expected axis
    ranges, since this may be a user's histogram.
  o RooUnfoldTest "seed" parameter allows random number seed to be set.

Tim Adye         17-Nov-2011
  o Fix for ROOT 5.12 and before, which doesn't have TH1::GetEffectiveEntries().
  o Remove std::vector definitions from RooUnfold dictionary.
    These gave warnings when the library was loaded into ROOT, where they were
    already defined.
  o GNUMakefile runs RooUnfold_LinkDef.h through the preprocessor before running
    rlibmap, so deselected classes aren't included in the rootmap.
  o Fix GNUMakefile for gmake 3.80 and before (eg. in SL4) which doesn't allow
    "else ifneq".
  o Remove spurious "cd" in rootcint make rule.
  o Remove gSystem->Load("libRooUnfold") from examples. That should happen
    automatically now that we have a libRooUnfold.rootmap.
  o Tidy up and expand help at the top of the GNUmakefile.
  o GNUmakefile can now build user programs in the current directory.

Tim Adye         15-Nov-2011
  o Protect against null RooUnfoldResponse fakes histogram pointer. This can
    arise if reading an object created with an old version of RooUnfold
    (prior to 1.1.0).

Tim Adye         14-Nov-2011
  o Fix trivial compiler warning.

Tim Adye          4-Nov-2011
  o GNUMakefile update for ROOT 5.32, which moved Makefile.arch from the test
    to the etc directory and renamed $(ROOTCONFIG) to $(RC).

Tim Adye         26-Oct-2011
  o Fix 3D RooUnfoldResponse::Fill.
  o When inverting a matrix (eg. for chi^2), show condition, determinant, and
    check inverse.
  o RooUnfold::Print() shows a nicer summary of the object.
  o RooUnfoldTest3D: fix fake test, change test defaults, plot 2D projections.
  o RooUnfoldTest doeff=0 addfakes=1 turn off/on all inefficiencies and fakes.
  o RooUnfoldTest2D+3D projections don't include under/overflow bins.

Tim Adye         25-Oct-2011
  o Add RooUnfoldTUnfold methods for retrieving the L Curve and the tau values
    if an L curve scan is done.
    This improvement was kindly provided by Pedro Cipriano.

Tim Adye         17-Oct-2011
  o Fix Bayes response matrix errors to include the effect of the dependency of
    the prior in one iteration on the response matrix in the previous iteration.
    This is analagous to the fix of 30-Jan-2011 to the measurement errors.
    See the updated doc/bayes_errors.pdf.
  o Simplify equation 3 in doc/bayes_errors.pdf.
  o If RooUnfold::IncludeSystematics(2) is used, compute just the systematic
    error, leaving out the measurement errors.
  o RooUnfoldTest name=X parameter allows one to specify a different name for
    the output files.
  o Use our local copy of TSVDUnfold for ROOT 5.28 and before,
    #defined as TSVDUnfold_529 to prevent a name clash with old version
    built into ROOT 5.28. For ROOT 5.29/02 and later, we can use ROOT's version.
  o Remove RooUnfoldSvd's _ntoyssvd parameter. Constructor argument and set/get
    methods are now depreciated (they just set/get RooUnfold's _NToys).
  o Add RooUnfoldTUnfold constructor that fixes regularisation parameter
    (equivalent to using SetRegParm).

Tim Adye         14-Oct-2011
  o Include effect of response matrix errors in unfolded errors if
    RooUnfold::IncludeSystematics() is set. This is still experimental and is
    currently only implemented for Bayes, SVD, TUnfold, and errors from toys.
    Includes a reimplementation of the Bayes response matrix error propagation.
    Use RooUnfoldTest dosys=1 to test.
  o Add another small speed-up of the Bayes error propagation if the measurement
    errors don't include bin-bin correlations.
  o Fix RooUnfoldErrors binning and chi^2 plot.
  o RooUnfoldTest bincorr=999 tests with full measurement covariance matrix that
    is diagonal (can check it's identical to not using the covariance matrix).
  o Fix response matrix error propagation matrix equation in doc/bayes_errors
    (eq. 7).

Tim Adye         13-Oct-2011
  o Optimise calculation of the error propagation matrix in RooUnfoldBayes using
    TMatrixD multiplication. This can speed it up by up to a factor of 5.

Tim Adye         10-Oct-2011
  (change originally made 04-Oct-2011, but not included in V01-01-01)
  o Update local copy of TSVDUnfold to ROOT trunk revision 40495 (similar to
    ROOT 5.30.00). This doesn't compile with ROOT 5.28 (need to fix this).
  o RooUnfoldSvd uses propagation of errors rather than toys (TSVDUnfold::GetXtau)
    and doesn't include errors on response matrix.
  o New RooUnfold::Wreco() method returns weight matrix of unfolded result.
    This is normally just the inverse of the covariance matrix, but can be
    calculated directly for RooUnfoldSvd using TSVDUnfold::GetXinv.
    The weights are used to calulcate the chi^2.
  o RooUnfoldInverse now works even if there are more truth than measured bins.
    This is done by transposing the response matrix, inverting, and transposing
    back ((A^-1)^T = (A^T)^-1 for pseudo-inverse).

Tim Adye         10-Oct-2011 V01-01-01
  o Allow RooUnfoldResponse(measured,truth,response) constructor and Setup
    method to take 0 or empty histogram for "measured" and/or "truth" in
    the case where there are no fakes and/or inefficiencies.
    With 0, a 1D histogram is assumed.
  o Calculated histogram of fakes now includes truth under/overflows from user's
    response matrix histogram. Errors are also calculated, even though these are
    not used at present.
  o Fix residuals histogram colours in RooUnfoldTest.

Tim Adye         05-Oct-2011
  o Fix uninitialsed pointer in RooUnfoldResponse::Vfakes. This fixes a crash
    reported by Katharina Bierwagen.
  o Add warning if the number of measured bins doesn't match the
    response matrix.

Tim Adye         30-Sep-2011 V01-01-00
  o Fix return of errors in RooUnfoldSvd.
  o Add warnings in RooUnfoldTUnfold and RooUnfoldDagostini if a full
    measurement covariance matrix was specified. These algorithms don't
    support the bin-bin correlations.
  o Add Bessel's correction (N/(N-1)) to error calculation from toys.
  o Don't usually print decomposed measurement covariance matrix when
    running toys.
  o RooUnfoldTest bincorr parameter sets test measurement bin-bin correlations
    (bincorr=-0.5 gives an anti-correlation of 0.5 between neighbouring bins,
    0.25 between next-to-neighbours, etc). Input correlation matrix is also
    plotted.
  o Make examples/RooUnfoldExample.py directly executable.

Tim Adye         29-Sep-2011
  o RooUnfoldResponse can now account for fakes (or background: measured entries
    with no truth). Use Fake(xmeas) to fill or add fakes to measured input
    histogram.
  o RooUnfoldTest can test fakes: specify fakexlo and fakexhi (and similarly
    for y and z) for linearly varying background level.
  o Allow RooUnfoldSVD to have different numbers of truth and measured bins.
    This is done by calling TSVDUnfold with a symmetric matrices with zeroes
    in the extra bins.
  o Fix RooUnfoldResponse::Miss, which should depend on measured dimensionality.
  o make html sets the product name, source directory, and library name from
    Makefile settings.

Tim Adye          9-Sep-2011
  o Work round stupid shared library option for MacOSX in Makefile.arch.
    This prevented libRooUnfold.so from being loaded, eg. by ACLiC.
  o Fix "unused parameter" warnings in RooUnfoldTestHarness.icc.

Tim Adye         22-Jun-2011
  o Rename local copy of TSVDUnfold.h to TSVDUnfold_local.h so as not to
    override ROOT's version if that exists. That caused a crash in ROOT 5.30
    due to a mismatch between the old header and the ROOT library with an
    updated class.
  o Added "make help" target.
  o Work round RooFit PDF normalisation bug in ROOT 5.29.02 (bug #83534)
    for RooUnfoldTest.

Tim Adye          2-Jun-2011
  o Add RooUnfoldBayes::UnfoldingMatrix accessor.

Tim Adye          6-Apr-2011
  o Add doc/phystat2011 conference write-up.

Tim Adye         28-Feb-2011
  o Include PDF documents in doc subdirectory.

Tim Adye         11-Feb-2011
  o Adjust streamer methods for compatibility with ROOT 5.14 and before.
  o Remove obsolete RooUnfold::Add_Random from header file.
  o Move doc/bayes_errors.tex to subdirectory doc/bayes_errors/ and add
    plots to demonstrate the fix.

Tim Adye          9-Feb-2011
  o RooUnfold::SetMeasured can also be passed vectors for measured distribution
    and errors, or a matrix for the covariance matrix. SetMeasuredCov just
    sets the covariance matrix. GetMeasuredCov retrieves it.
    All error calculations except RooUnfoldTUnfold with error propagation
    use the full measurement covariance matrix if specified.
  o RooUnfold::RunToy() returns new RooUnfold object.
    RunToy() replaces old Runtoy() method, which returned a histogram.

Tim Adye          4-Feb-2011
  o Add I/O streamers for RooUnfold and its subclasses.
  o Fix RooUnfold::New when name but not title is specified.
  o Fix RooUnfold::PrintTable for when hTrue isn't specified.
  o RooUnfoldTest now writes histograms and unfold object to RooUnfoldTest.root
    (previously just response object was written there).
  o RooUnfoldTest no longer defaults doerror=1 for Bayes. Just calculating the
    bin-by-bin errors is no longer any faster.
  o Add doc/bayes_errors.tex describing new (30-Jan-2011) RooUnfoldBayes
    error calculation.
  o Allow use of old RooUnfoldBayes errors (for comparison) by defining OLDERRS.

Tim Adye         30-Jan-2011
  o Rewrote RooUnfoldBayes to perform the unfolding itself instead of calling
    RooUnfoldBayesImpl. RooUnfoldBayesImpl and Array2D removed from the package.
    Uses TMatrixD and TVectorD (instead of Array2D and vector<double>), which is
    faster. Further optimised code.
  o Improved RooUnfoldBayes error calculation to take account of dependence of
    Mij on the measurements, n(Ej), via the previous iterations which update
    P0(Ci). The new errors now agree with the toy MC - previously they were
    underestimated (by a factor 1.4 in the default RooUnfoldTest). Unfortunately
    this new calculation is quite a bit slower so, overall, the new version is
    slower than the old (even if errors aren't calculated, since the propagation
    matrix has to be calculated in case it is needed) - but still pretty fast
    compared to other unfolding methods.
  o Delete toy unfold object at end of RooUnfold::Runtoy (memory leak noted
    by Seth Zenz).
  o Optimise RooUnfoldErrors: if the chi^2 is not required, then it does not
    need to get the unfolding errors on the toys.
  o RooUnfoldTest ploterrors=1 no longer calculates chi^2 distribution.
    This allows a faster comparison of the errors. The plot now has a legend.
    Use ploterrors=2 to include the chi^2 plot.

Tim Adye         24-Jan-2011
  o Makefile creates libRooUnfold.rootmap, which can be used to load RooUnfold
    in PyROOT.
  o Added examples/RooUnfoldExample.py, equivalent to RooUnfoldExample.cxx.
    If ROOT was built PyROOT support and the correct version of Python is used,
    RooUnfoldExample.py can be run with: python -i examples/RooUnfoldExample.py

Tim Adye         21-Jan-2011
  o Fix RooUnfoldTestHarness::PrintMatrix default argument.

Tim Adye         19-Jan-2011
  o RooUnfoldTest: rationalise use of onepage parameter so it prints all plots
    with onepage=0 and no more than onepage otherwise.
  o RooUnfoldTest: plot correlation matrix. Print error matrix if verbose=2.

Tim Adye         17-Jan-2011
  o RooUnfoldTest: scale measured histogram to match the truth if the number
    of bins is different.

Tim Adye         14-Jan-2011
  o Restore missing measured scatter plot with RooUnfoldTest2D onepage=0.

Tim Adye         14-Jan-2011 V01-00-03
  o Use CXXFLAGS for Fortran compilation (if bayes.for is present), so it
    picks up -m32 with 32-bit ROOT on 64-bit machine.

Tim Adye         13-Jan-2011
  o Comment methods for RooUnfoldResponse and unfolding algorithm classes
    for class documentation.
  o Fix RooUnfoldTest help.

Tim Adye         12-Jan-2011
  o RooUnfoldSvd now uses TSVDUnfold, which is based on Kerstin Tackmann's
    old implementation class, RooUnfHistoSvd. TSVDUnfold is included in
    ROOT 2.28 and later, but RooUnfold has a copy which is used with older
    versions of ROOT.
  o Reorder settings in GNUMakefile and add some comments on the various
    optional parts.

Tim Adye         11-Jan-2011
  o Add -lFoam -lMathMore to link (required by RooFit for some installations)
    and only link against these extra libraries if present in $ROOTSYS/lib.
  o Fixes for ROOT versions 5.12 and before (different TDecompSVD::Invert() and
    no TString::Format()).

Tim Adye         30-Nov-2010
  o Hack to RooUnfoldTestHarness.icc to work round CINT crash on
    MacOSX x86_64 (ROOT bug #75874). Crash reported by Julia Gray.
  o Fix empty-bin logic in RooUnfold::Chi2(kErrors).

Tim Adye         23-Nov-2010
  o Hack GNUMakefile so "make bin" works on MacOS: uses libRooUnfold_static.a
    symlink to bypass linking shared library.
    Also tidied up use of automatic variables.

Tim Adye          8-Oct-2010 tja101008a
  o RooUnfoldResponse can now take any TH2, not just TH2D. Hresponse() returns
    a TH2, but everything else returns new TH2Ds.
  o Fixes for when user's TH1s aren't doubles.
  o Remove unneeded internal routines RooUnfold::HmeasuredNoOverflow1D() and
    RooUnfoldResponse::Hmeasured1D() and Htruth1D().

Tim Adye          4-Oct-2010 tja101004b
  o Use SVN Id keyword substitution.

Tim Adye          4-Oct-2010 tja101004a
  o New RooUnfoldResponse::Add method, suggested by Seth Zenz.
  o Protections against failure in Unfold() and GetCov() etc.
    Use RooUnfold::_fail to ensure that Unfold() is not retried on failure.
  o RooUnfoldBayes::SetIterations() and SetSmoothing() no longer virtual.
  o Add RooUnfoldDagostini class. This is an interface to D'Agostini's bayes.for
    for comparison with our RooUnfoldBayes (they implement the same algorithm).
    RooUnfoldDagostini is not normally compiled, but will be if bayes.for and
    bayes_c.for are copied into the src directory. These can be downloaded from
    http://www.roma1.infn.it/~dagos/bayes_distr.txt .

Tim Adye         15-Sep-2010 tja100915a
  o Reformat method definitions so they appear correctly in the
    ROOT class documentation.

Tim Adye         14-Sep-2010 tja100914a
  o RooUnfoldResponse::HresponseNoOverflow() and RooUnfold::HistNoOverflow()
    clear under/overflow bins. TUnfold uses the underflow bins of the response
    matrix, so they shouldn't have other stuff in them.
  o RooUnfoldTest bias model is now a quartic so as not to have a bump in the
    middle.
  o RooUnfoldTest doesn't generate events in the under/overflow bins unless
    overflow=1, and then only do the same as the neighbouring bin.

Tim Adye         13-Sep-2010 V01-00-02
  o RooUnfold::Chi2 uses kCovariance ErrorTreatment by default.

Tim Adye         10-Sep-2010 tja100910c
  o RooUnfold::SetMeasured() ensures Vmeasured() and Emeasured() caches are
    cleared.
  o Use new RooUnfoldResponse::GetBinContent and GetBinError routines instead
    of TH1::GetBinContent(GetBin()) etc.
  o Tidy up RooUnfold::Chi2() and fix for multi-dimensional case.
  o Rename RooUnfold::CopyOverflow() to HistNoOverflow().
  o New RooUnfold::HmeasuredNoOverflow1D() method.
  o Fix RooUnfold::Vmeasured() and Emeasured() with overflows.
  o Correct RooUnfoldResponse documentation comments.
  o Speed up RooUnfoldResponse::GetBinDim().
  o Fix RooUnfoldResponse::H2V(), V2H(), H2VE(), H2M(), and H2ME() for
    multi-dimensional histograms.

Tim Adye         10-Sep-2010 tja100910b
  o RooUnfoldTUnfold now does 2D and 3D regularisation.

Tim Adye         10-Sep-2010 tja100910a
  o RooUnfold*::Impl() method is now a specific method for each algorithm,
    returning the correct type, rather than virtual returning a TObject*.
  o Use TUnfold::kHistMapOutputVert instead of transposing response matrix.

Tim Adye         27-Aug-2010 tja100827d
  o Add RooUnfold::Vmeasured() and Emeasured() to return the measured
    distribution and its errors as TVectorD.
  o Remove unused RooUnfold::NBins() and HaveErrors() methods.
  o Rename RooUnfold::GetErrorObject() to UnfoldWithErrors(). This now always
    does an Unfold() first.
  o Move RooUnfoldSvd::CopyOverflow() to the base clase, RooUnfold, so
    RooUnfoldTUnfold doesn't need its own version. It is now static.
  o Remove unneccessary mutable property on most RooUnfold members.
  o RooUnfold::_nm and _nt now count in the under/overflow bins. This simplifies
    the logic nearly everywhere.
  o Rename RooUnfold::_errors to _variances, since it holds errors squared.
  o RooUnfold::ErecoV() returns a vector of errors, not variances.
  o Replace various instances of RooUnfold::Hreco(),
    RooUnfoldResponse::Hresponse(), Hmeasured(), and Htruth() with direct
    TVectorD/TMatrixD equivalents, when that is more convenient.
    Also, use _nt and _nm instead of GetNbinsX() etc.
  o Make RooUnfold::Init(), Destroy(), and CopyData() methods private, since
    these should not be inherited.
  o RooUnfoldBayes::Destroy() didn't do much, so replace it with its contents.
  o Fill RooUnfoldBinByBin::_cov in Unfold(), so GetCov() has nothing to do.
  o TDecompSVD is now the RooUnfoldInvert::Impl() object. Use Solve() rather
    than Invert() for unfolding (Invert() still used for errors).
  o Speed up RooUnfoldInvert::GetCov() symmetric matrix multiplication.
  o New RooUnfoldResponse::HresponseNoOverflow() method to replace
    RooUnfoldSvd::CopyOverflow2D(Hresponse()).

Tim Adye         27-Aug-2010 tja100827b
  o Fix long-standing CINT crash in RooUnfoldTest with more than one parameter:
    for some reason it didn't like making a TString at a certain point.

Tim Adye         27-Aug-2010 tja100827a
  o Fix some Mac GCC 4.2.1 warnings.

Richard Claridge 26-Aug-2010 rgc100826a

  o Fix crash testing reading response matrix from a file.

Tim Adye         25-Aug-2010 tja100825b
  o Bin-by-bin and invert unfolding methods don't work well if there is a
    systematic bias (or 2D rotation), but they aren't too bad with some smearing.
    In RooUnfoldTest, this is now controlled by an 'addbias' parameter, which
    is off by default for those methods. (Previously 'dosmear' allowed disabling
    of both smearing and bias, by default just for the bin-by-bin method.)
  o Fix some warnings when compiling on a Mac.
  o Separate off code into RooUnfoldTestHarness::PlotErrors and PlotParms.

Tim Adye         25-Aug-2010 tja100825a

Tim Adye         19-Jul-2010 tja100719a
  o Added Clone method for RooUnfold and subclasses.
  o Add RooUnfoldSvd destructor.
  o RooUnfold::Print shows bin-by-bin chi^2 for comparison with full chi^2.
  o RooUnfoldTest iterations=0 disables ensemble tests.

Tim Adye         16-Jul-2010 tja100716b
  o Remove ClassDefs in examples and GNUMakefile changes for the moment.

Tim Adye         16-Jul-2010 tja100716a
  o Add ClassDefs for classes in examples. Add rootcint for them in GNUMakefile.

  o Default error no longer uses a sqrt.

Tim Adye         14-Jul-2010 tja100714a
  o Remove -Woverloaded-virtual -Wno-deprecated from GNUmakefile, since these
    warnings have been fixed.
  o New named constructor, RooUnfold::New() to create object based on
    RooUnfold::Algorithm enum.
  o RooUnfold::SetRegParm and GetRegParm give common method to set an interger
    regularisation parameter for those algorithms that require it.

  o Tidy up RooUnfoldTest display and printing options.
  o Add wpaper and hpaper options for paper width and height.
  o Show projections of 2D pulls.

Tim Adye         25-May-2010 tja100525a
  o RooUnfold can now include the under/overflow bins. This is set by
    RooUnfoldResponse::UseOverflow(). Currently only works for 1D.
    Still to fix: RooUnfoldSvd now leaks a few histograms.
  o RooUnfoldTest "overflow" option: 0=ignore under/overflows, 1=unfolding uses
    overflows, 2=show under/overflow bins on test histograms.

Tim Adye         24-May-2010 tja100524a
  RooUnfoldTest chanegs:
  o Add legends to plots
  o Fix Postscript output when onepage=0
  o Generate truth over a wider range than histogram (according to bias and
    smearing) to allow for migration in/out of the range.

Tim Adye         20-May-2010 V00-02-02
Tim Adye         20-May-2010 tja100520a
  o Fix RooUnfoldBayes for when the measured and truth distributions have
    different numbers of bins. (Problem reported by Lluis Marti.)
  o Fix RooUnfoldSvd to fill kterm and ntoys correctly (broken in tja100125b).
  o New accessor methods for unfolding parameters and implementation object.
  o Can control the verbosity of messages with RooUnfold::SetVerbose(level):
    0=warnings, 1=verbose (default, as before), 2=debug, 3=detailed.
  o Don't repeat fatal RooUnfoldSvd errors
  o examples/ArgVars element (ArgVar) now a TNamed, with argument name and help
    text stored in the name and title respectively.
  o Add original truth plot to RooUnfoldExample.cxx.

Tim Adye         19-May-2010 V00-02-01
Tim Adye         14-May-2010 tja100514a
  o RooUnfoldTest*.cxx now also works with ACLiC (.L RooUnfoldTest.cxx+).
    Requires explicit gSystem->Load("libRooUnfold") and .include src .

Tim Adye         21-Mar-2010 tja100321a
  o Fix one-time memory leak in RooUnfoldBayesImpl.cxx found by cppcheck.

Tim Adye         17-Mar-2010 tja100317a
  o Remove gcc 4.1.2 compiler warning in examples/ArgVars.icc.

Tim Adye         25-Jan-2010 tja100125b
  o Reorganise RooUnfold classes so as not to have hidden virtual methods
    (Setup and Clear) and to perform unfolding on demand, rather than on
    construction.
  o Fix signed-unsigned comparison warnings.
  RooUnfoldTest changes:
  o rename Print to PrintParms to remove clash with TNamed::Print.
  o method=0 now runs RooUnfold base: this just copies input.

Tim Adye         25-Jan-2010 tja100125a
  RooUnfoldTest changes:
  o Don't allow positional parameters any more.
  o Work round CINT bug in ROOT 5.18+ which required ".include examples" to
    run RooUnfoldTest.cxx.
  o Work round CINT bug in ROOT 5.18 (just that) which doesn't parse
    RooUnfoldTest parameters correctly. Unfortunately there still are problems
    with this version (eg. only the first argument is accepted).

Tim Adye         22-Jan-2010 V00-02-00
  o Add missing include for TProfile.
  o Add make html target.

Tim Adye         22-Jan-2010 tja100122a
  o RooUnfold::PrintTable: fix bin numbering (no under/overlow) and show 2D/3D
    bin numbers.
  o RooUnfoldBayes: fix if there are fewer measured than truth bins.
  o RooUnfoldTest3D: show X, Y, and Z profile plots for pulls.
  o Remove RooUnfoldTest() routines with numeric parameters.
  o Reorder RooUnfoldTestHarness routines.

Tim Adye         21-Jan-2010 tja100121a
  RooUnfoldTest changes:
  o Change xlo:xhi etc ranges to 0:10
  o New parameters mtrainx, wtrainx, mtestx, wtestx (and for y, z) specify PDFs.
    Background fraction parameters renamed btrainx and btestx (and for y, z).
  o effxlo, effxhi, xbias, xsmear can be specified separately for y and z.
  o New parameter dosmear.
  o Rotation is about the central point, not (0,0).
  o Nicer defaults for 2D and 3D cases.
  o Add simple exponential background PDF. Take tau from mean parameter
    (also for exponential+Gaussian).
  o Fix no-RooFit exponential PDF (only generates in xlo:xhi).

Tim Adye         20-Jan-2010 tja100120d
  o Fix RooUnfold::PrintTable() for multi-dimensional case.
  o Tidy some default object names.

Tim Adye         20-Jan-2010 tja100120c
  RooUnfoldTest changes:
  o Use flat training PDF by default.
  o No-RooFit PDFs now handle flat PDFs and background. exp+resonance PDF fixed.
  o Show test input histograms even if unfolding fails.

Tim Adye         20-Jan-2010 tja100120b
  o RooUnfold::PrintTable() doesn't show residuals and pulls for "empty" bins
    (both content=0 and error=0) and doesn't include in chi^2.
  RooUnfoldTest changes:
  o Reorganise including of examples/*.icc. Disabled with NOINLINE.
  o Smearing function parameters can now be specified as efflo, effhi, bias,
    smear, rotxy, rotxz, and rotyz.
  o Rot() now does a proper rotation rather than mixing.
  o Residuals and pulls histograms now calculated the same for 1D,2D,3D and
    ignore "empty" bins.

Tim Adye         20-Jan-2010 tja100120a
  o Fixes for older versions of ROOT (eg. 5.12).

Tim Adye         19-Jan-2010 tja100119c
  o RooUnfoldSvd may not work very well for multi-dimensional distributions,
    so print warning if it's tried.
  o Protect against /0 error in RooUnfoldBayesImpl::train.
  o More detailed RooUnfoldTest help.
  o RooUnfoldTest PDFs include constant background (currently only with RooFit).
  o Longer RooUnfoldTest canvas.
  o RooUnfoldTest works in CINT again.

Tim Adye         19-Jan-2010 tja100119b
  o Tidy up comments.

Tim Adye         19-Jan-2010 tja100119a
  o New RooUnfoldTestHarness2D inherits from RooUnfoldTestHarness and
    RooUnfoldTestHarness3D inherits from that.
  o Arguments now parsed with examples/ArgVars.
  o RooUnfoldTest(2D,3D) can now have separate ntx, nty, ntz, nmx, nmy, nmz.

Tim Adye         13-Jan-2010 tja100113a
  o Small reorganisation of RooUnfoldBayesImpl. User no longer calls train()
    or trainBinByBin() directly. This is now done in unfold() or
    unfoldBinByBin() (which specify the unfolding algorithm parameters,
    iterations and smoothit), since the training now requires the unfolding
    input. Of course users of RooUnfoldBayes and RooUnfoldBinByBin won't see any
    difference, since they wrap RooUnfoldBayesImpl.
  o RooUnfoldTest uses new RooUnfoldTestHarness object to run tests and keeps
    all test parameters, so we don't have to pass them everywhere.
  o New RooUnfoldTest onepage parameter.
  o RooUnfoldTest -h or --help displays defaults.

Tim Adye         12-Jan-2010 tja100112a
  o RooUnfoldBayesImpl::train should use data input rather than MC input for
    n(Ej). This is _nEstj[] rather _nEj[]. This means that setupUnfold() must
    be called before train() - maybe these routines need tidying up.
    Problem reported Jan Kapitan.
  o RooUnfoldBayesImpl::train should normalise _nCi to 1 for the initial P0(C)
    rather than Nobs.
  o RooUnfoldBayesImpl::train: remove redundent TStopwatch timer.
  o RooUnfoldBayesImpl::getCovariance option doUnfoldSystematic to enable
    systematic calculation. It remains disabled by default: I'm not sure it is
    correct, it is very slow, and the effect should be small with good MC
    statistics.
  o RooUnfold::PrintTable fixed for _nm!=_nt. Print test truth (hTrue), which
    is now optional.
  o RooUnfoldTest(2D,3D) can now be run with parameters specified by name, not
    just positional. Eg. RooUnfoldTest regparm=6 or RooUnfoldTest("regparm=6")
    from the ROOT prompt.

Tim Adye         11-Jan-2010 tja100111a
  o Move RooUnfoldBayesImpl.cxx description to top of file and tidy.
  o Remove unneccessary vector copy.

Tim Adye         22-Dec-2009 tja091222a
  o RooUnfoldTest2D: fix 2D rotation.
  o Add RooUnfoldTest3D.cxx.

Tim Adye         14-Oct-2009 V00-01-09
Tim Adye         24-Aug-2009 tja090824a
  o Fixes for GCC 4.3.3, suggested by Ioana Maris.

Tim Adye          5-Jun-2009 tja090612a
  o RooUnfold::PrintTable prints a table of the results and Chi^2/NDF
    (moved from RooUnfoldTest).
  o RooUnfoldTest prints RooUnfold object.
  o Fix assignment of RooUnfold derived classes.
  o Don't repeat RooUnfold::Setup when constructing derived classes.
  o Fix RooUnfoldBinByBin construction, which was actually doing the
    RooUnfoldBayes setup.
  o Add missing RooUnfoldBinByBin constructors.
  o Add make VERBOSE=1 to display compilation commands.

Tim Adye          5-Jun-2009 tja090605a
  o bin-by-bin was actually running the full bayes code.
  o SVD prints error if kterm is negative or greater than the number of bins.
  o Tidy up some includes and namespaces in RooUnfoldBayesImpl.cxx and
    RooUnfoldTest.cxx.
  o RooUnfoldTest can test different numbers of bins in truth and measured
    distributions.
  o RooUnfoldTest prints a table of the results (not in cint) and Chi^2/NDF.

Tim Adye         26-May-2009 tja090527a
  o Allow weight to be specified with RooUnfoldResponse::Fill() and Miss().
    Defaults to 1.0, so no change if not specified.

Tim Adye         26-May-2009 tja090526a
  o RooUnfoldResponse::Fill() and Miss() fix for variable binning in 1D case.
    Use case highlighted by Seth Zenz.

Tim Adye         22-May-2009 V00-01-08
  o Add RooUnfoldResponse::ApplyToTruth based on idea and code from
    Seth Zenz.

Tim Adye         22-May-2009 V00-01-07
Tim Adye         10-Oct-2008
  o Don't calculate covariance matrix unless required. This can be a slow
    operation for the Bayes algorithm. RooUnfoldBayesImpl does not call
    getCovariance after unfolding - now done automatically in RooUnfoldBayes.
  o Fix conversion of multi-dimensional distributions to 1D (for use in response
    matrix and in Bayes algorithm). Under/overflow bins are ignored.
    RooUnfoldResponse::GetBin and FindBin convert from and to a vector index.
  o Fix RooUnfoldTestPdfRooFit's double-sided exponential distribution.
    No longer gives warnings about out-of-range values.
  o RooUnfoldTest2D only calculates errors with the Bayes algorithm
    for <=25 bins. It takes a long time for more bins (goes as the 4th power
    of the number of bins).

Tim Adye         28-Aug-2008 tja080828a
  o New routine RooUnfold::GetBin returns global bin for multi-dimensional
    histogram corresponding to vector index. This fixes RooUnfold::Hreco and
    RooUnfoldBayes::H2VD. Bug reported by Peter Waller.

Tim Adye         19-Aug-2008 V00-01-06
  o Copy updated setmax (just name and comments) and smear to RooUnfoldTest2D.

Tim Adye         14-Aug-2008 tja080814a
  o Fix inefficiency simulation in RooUnfoldTest. Now goes from 0.3 at low x
    to 1 at high x as before.

Fergus Wilson    14-Aug-2008 ffw140808a
  o Bayesian Systematc error calculation due to unfolding matrix
    disabled while investigate normalisation.

Tim Adye          6-Aug-2008 tja080813b
  o Add missing include file to RooUnfoldTest.
  o Fix for onepage==3.

Tim Adye          6-Aug-2008 tja080813a
  o Removed $ROOTSYS fallback in Makefile. That wouldn't work because
    $ROOTSYS/test/Makefile.arch would have already exited.

Fergus Wilson    13-Aug-2008 ffw130808c
  o Improved version of the Bayesian systematc error calculation.
  o Bayesian Systematic error calculation no longer done during
    training/testing.

  o Remember to remove debug code.

Fergus Wilson    13-Aug-2008 ffw130808a
  o speeded up Bayesian covariance matrix at least factor two.

  o Changed smear method so it now works for different x-axis ranges.
    Efficiency correctly goes from 1.0 at low x to 0.3 at high x; shift is
    10% of the range; smearing is now 1 bin width.
  o RooUnfoldTest: change colors and markers to use names rather than numbers.
    Added a pulls histogram; Draw a line at y=0 on residual plot; added simple
    checking of some command line parameters.
  o RooUnfoldTestPdf: added a new distribution of exponential decaying
    background and a resonance (i.e. Higgs-like).
  o RooUnfoldBayesImpl: added a chi^2 method. Added 1-D smoothing. Speeded
    up covarinace matrix.

  o Get include directory from root-config --incdir as suggested by
    Peter Waller.
  o More robust GNUmakefile. If $ROOTSYS/test/Makefile.arch doesn't exist, it
    gets settings from root-config. If that doesn't exist, it assumes everything
    is below $ROOTSYS in the standard places. These fallbacks probably won't
    work on anything except Linux.
  o Use -lRooFitCore if available (seems to be needed with ROOT 5.18 Cygwin).
  o Use make ROOTBUILD=debug for debug build.
  o Use make commands to see compiler options to be used.

Tim Adye         23-Jan-2008 V00-01-05
  o Include missing headers for ROOT 5.16/00.
  o Fix RooUnfoldTest2D.ps file name.
  o Rename RooUnfoldSvd's tau parameter to kterm to match Hoecker and
    Kartvelishvili's usage (they use k for the last term used in the expansion).

  RooUnfHistoSvd improvements:
  o Replace use of copy constructors by use of Clone. This should get rid of the
    segfaults that Jochen has been seeing.
  o Fixed bug in TUnfHisto::GetCov that could lead to small numerical changes in
    the estimated uncertainties.
  o Tested on my spectrum that the changes, which were supposed to be only
    clean-up between the previous two tags (Tim's and mine), do indeed give
    identical results on the curvature of the weight distributions and the
    errors.

Tim Adye          5-Apr-2007 V00-01-03
  o Fixes to build on Solaris.

Tim Adye          5-Apr-2007 V00-01-02
  o By default, build test programs with static RooUnfold library,
    so don't need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  o Only link programs that need RooFit against RooFit.
  o Default NOROOFIT=1 if RooFit is not available.
  o Move README examples to the web page.

Tim Adye          4-Apr-2007 V00-01-01
  o Combine RooUnfHistoSvd and RooUnfold into a single stand-alone package.
  o Rewritten standalone GNUMakefile.
  o Combined History entries below.

Tim Adye         14-Nov-2006 tja061114a
  o Use TVectorDfwd.h in ROOT5

  o RooUnfHistoSvd: Clean up of code, mostly in the form of getting rid of the
    many many couts and the GetBias methods, which where not working the way we
    wanted (technically they were, but they did not turn out useful to estimate
    the bias).

Tim Adye          9-Aug-2006 tja060809a
  o Allow zero regularisation parameter in RooUnfoldTest.cc.
  o Simpler pad selection in 2-up display RooUnfoldTest.cc.

Tim Adye         15-Dec-2005 tja051215a
  o Fix some typos in comments
  o Add reference to pre-built ROOT docs to README

Tim Adye         12-Dec-2005 V00-00-03
  o Add RooUnfoldExample.cc.
  o Use Int_t consistently in test routines.
  o Tidy up README.

Tim Adye         12-Dec-2005 V00-00-01
  o First RooUnfold version with Bayes, SVD, and bin-by-bin methods.

Tim Adye         12-Dec-2005 tja051212a
  o Initialise all RooUnfHistoSvd member variables on object creation.
  o Allow TUnfHisto::init caller to disable creation of results file.
  o Add GNUmakefile to allow also building outside BaBar environment.

Kerstin Tackmann 22-Nov-2005 kt221105
  o RooUnfHistoSvd: fixed the tau==25 problem

Tim Adye         18-Nov-2005 tja051118a
  RooUnfHistoSvd tweaks:
  o Declare method parameters "const" where appropriate.
  o Declare methods const or static where appropriate.
  o Pass vectors and matrices by const reference, rather than by value.
  o Don't forget to delete a few new'ed objects.

Kerstin Tackmann 30-Sep-2005 kt093005
  RooUnfHistoSvd improvements:
  o Much better use of memory
  o Fixed bug in GetBias
  o Commented the GetBias methods out to make sure people are aware that they
    should be more carefully tested on specific spectra than the general
    unfolding...

Kerstin Tackmann 15-Dec-2004 KT121504
  o RooUnfHistoSvd: Initial commit of current code
