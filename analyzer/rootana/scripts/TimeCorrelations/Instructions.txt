This script loops through a ROOT file and saves some of the plots as PDFs, while creating a tex file that can be used to make a beamer presentation

pdflatex is not available on merlin so you will probably have to copy files locally

To use this script:
 - run rootana with the config script configurations/correlations_for_meeting_2017-01-10.cfg or configurations/correlations-w-rough-time-cut_for_meeting_2017-01-10.cfg
 - on your local machine:
   - scp the out.root file and CreateCorrelationsBook.C
   - "mkdir figs"
   - edit CreateCorrelationsBook.C so that "filename" is the name of your file and that the title of the resulting tex file
   - run "root -l -b CreateCorrelationsBook.C"
   - quit root
   - scp main.tex
   - run "pdflatex main.tex"
